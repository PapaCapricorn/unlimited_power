# Unlimited Power!

A basic monte carlo simulator for Eternal (https://www.direwolfdigital.com/eternal/).

Most of the simulation happens in deck.py-this handles drawing new cards, power, mulligans, etc.  For an example of how to use it see 75_monte_carlo.py or cookbook.py (this last one is mostly stupid fun).

It currently supports importing the power base from deck exports, but I want to add extracting deck power and influence targets from it as well.
